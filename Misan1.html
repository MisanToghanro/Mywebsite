                     <h2>How bad are the effects of climate change in NIGERIA?</h2>
                     <p><u>Nigeria</u>, being one of the world largest oil producing countries, is now  experiencing significant changes in weather conditions now more than ever ! These changes include drought and reduced rainfall.Thus,affecting agricultural production and promoting food security.Rise in sea levels, which has caused flooding, resulting in the death of citizens and loss of property.</p>
                     <p>According to google– The increased level of floods and rising sea levels in Nigeria has affected 7 million people in communities across 33 states.More than 2 million people out of the 7 million were driven from their homes by siding water.Increased health risks for its citizens,due to the harmful release of toxic gasses to the atmosphere.</p>

                     <h2>What is responsible for this problem?</h2>
                     <h3> Human activities!</h3>
                     <p> Activities such as deforestation, burning of fossil fuels & emission of carbon dioxide & methane  have helped in depleting the earth's ozone layer, thereby making climate change the single biggest threat facing humanity–according to google. Nigeria, being very dependent on oil production & agriculture, is now experiencing these drastic changes like never before.</p>

                 <section>
                     <h2>What are the possible political reasons why this problem exists and continues?</h2>
                     <p>Nigeria's history of corruption & political instability has contributed to lack of consistent policy & frequent changes in administration.This has hindered the ability of the government to create & implement long term climate policies & initiatives.</p>

                 <section>
                     <h2>Which groups of people are primarily impacted by this problem?</h2>
                     <p>Due to the intense increase in weather temperatures, young children,pregnant women,older adults and people with medical conditions are less able to regulate their body temperature and are more vulnerable to this excessive heat.</p> 
                     <p> This intense rise in heat temperatures and less rainfall in Nigeria, also hampers agricultural production, thereby affecting farmers and Nigeria's economy as food insecurity rises.</p>
                     <h2>How does the problem affect each group?</h2>
                     <p>For farmers,less rainfalls and more drought has reduced crop yield, thereby reducing income for farmers and increasing food insecurity in the country</p>
                     <p>Exposure to more ultra violet rays, health risks in both adults and children has    increased! According to Nigeria health watch, 235 million people, with 51% being children are disproportionately impacted by climate change.<a href="https://articles.nigeriahealthwatch.com/children-and-the-future-of-health-in-a-changing-climate">Read more info</a></p>
